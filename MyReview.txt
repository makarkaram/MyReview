-no links to github pages.

Pages
-classes and variables are written incorrectly (signoutLink -> signOutLink)
(loginPage -> LoginPage).

loginPage.ts
-so as not to write "emailId: string", etc., add "noImplicitAny": false
in "compilerOptions" in "tsconfig.json"
-in Line 4 signinLink should belong to the main page which will be
inherited by other pages.

.gitignore
-reports and reports/** are repeated twice in gitignor
-cypress/downloads doesn't exist
-video and screenshots are already in the reports folder

test
-delete unused imports
-The MyAccount.test.ts does not test declared functionality. 

login.test
-on line 12 Test values ​​are not entered into the main code, they must be
handed over to helper or fixtures.
-in test t("login with valid credentials") and in it('login with valid credentials read data from
fixture')
repeating the same functions.
-lines 14,15,20,21 contain irrelevant code.
-on line 34 No newline before password argument as in
previous tests.
-Line 35 Wrong error message (‘Invalid email addressssss.’)

users.json
-Wrong data name. Naming variables "invalid_password" and "invalid_email"
Is incorrect if the array is similarly named "invalid_credentials".
-Fixutes file contains duplicated test data. The
structure of the test data is overcomplicated.
File contains duplicated test data. The structure of the test data

Project structure
-in the docs folder, a bunch of junk files generated by the "allure:generate" command.
-the file config.config.ts is named incorrectly, it would be more correct to write cypress.config.ts.

"npm i"
